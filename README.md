## Usage

Now that the user has read through the installation process they can now read through this section to understand the usage. Below is a list of instructions with images for the user to follow to understand how the application is used/runs.

---
Once the repository is opened in an IDE the user should right click on the 'server.js' file and open an integrated terminal. In said terminal the user should type in 'node server' and hit the enter key. A message will then be shown that will take the user to a local host. The user will have the option of clicking the 'follow link' if they hover the mouse over the HTTP link. Or they can type out 'http://localhost:5505 in their web browser or [insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) application. Insomnia is not needed but is nice to use.

 This is what the front of the application will look like once the user opens the local host link or manually types it in their browser. The user can then click on the 'get started' button and it will take them to the note taking page.

Below is an image of what the not taking page looks like. If the user chooses to go back to the main page they can click on 'Note Taker' located on the top left corner of the page. To the left is a list of previous entries. The users entries will be saved and show up next time they open up the application. They can choose to delete their entries by clicking on the garbage can icon. Where it says 'taking notes' in big letters is where the user can type in the title of the note. When it's blank it will say 'Note Title'. After writing the title the user can then hit the tab key or click on the space below the title to begin writing notes. If the user wishes to save said not they can click on the icon to the left of the Flus sign icon to save it. If the user wishes to delete what they have written and start over they can just click on the plus sign icon.

## Future

If I were to make additions to this application I would add a field to add a date and timme for each entry. I would also create another database json file to keep discarded entries to review at a later date. I would also make it so that you can edit previous entries with a time stamp of when the note was edited.
